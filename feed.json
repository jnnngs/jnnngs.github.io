            "content_html": "<h2>Configure First Domain</h2>\n<p>The default configuration file for Nginx is <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>, and we’re free to add our domains to this configuration. However, it is strongly recommended not do that. The single, biggest reason not to combine all domains in one configuration is that it will become very unwieldy, and cumbersome to maintain. Rather, it is advised to create individual configuration files for each domain, placing them in the <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code> directory. There is a <code>default</code> file that is created as part of the initial install, so feel free it use that or rename it to something more meaningful.</p>\n<p>The key to then enabling the domain, is to create a symbolic link to the <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</code> directory. The default file is already included, so nothing to do if you have reused this file. If you have renamed it to something meaningful, then run the following line command create the symbolic link.</p>\n<p><code>sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\">MEANINGFUL_NAME</span> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\">MEANINGFUL_NAME</span></code></p>\n<p>NB: It is common practice to name the files with an <code>.conf</code> extension, although it is not required to do so</p>\n<h2>Configure Second Domain</h2>\n<p>In order to create and activate the second domain, you should copy the <code>default</code> (or whatever you renamed it to)  file within <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code> and amend accordingly. </p>\n<p><code>cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/<span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\">domain_two</span></code></p>\n<p>In order for Nginx to know which configuration file to use, it references the inbound domain against the server_name configuration within the server block. Example below:-</p>\n<pre>server {\n     listen 80;\n     listen [::]:80;\n     server_name domain-two.com www.domain-two.com;\n\n     root /var/www/domain-two.com/public_html;\n\n     index index.html index.htm;\n\n     location / {\n          try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n     }\n}</pre>\n<p>Following this, you need to create the symbolic link.</p>\n<p><code>sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\">domain_two</span> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\">domain_two</span></code></p>\n<h2>Start or restart the Nginx service</h2>\n<p><code>sudo systemctl start nginx</code></p>\n<p>If Nginx is already running, reload all configuration files without stopping the service.</p>\n<p><code>sudo systemctl reload nginx</code></p>\n<p>Verify that Nginx is running.</p>\n<p><code>sudo systemctl status nginx</code></p>",
