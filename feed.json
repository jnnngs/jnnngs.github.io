And if you <a href=\"https://linuxhandbook.com/df-command/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check the disk space in Linux</a>, you’ll see that sometimes, it takes several GB of space.</p>\n<p>First check the space taken by journal logs with the <a href=\"https://linuxhandbook.com/find-directory-size-du-command/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">du command</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>du -sh /var/log/journal/</code></pre>\n<p>You can also use the journalctl command for the same task:</p>\n<pre><code>journalctl --disk-usage</code></pre>\n<p>Both of the command should give approximately the same result:</p>\n<pre><code>abhishek@linuxhandbook:~$ journalctl --disk-usage\nArchived and active journals take up 1.6G in the file system.\n\nabhishek@linuxhandbook:~$ sudo du -sh /var/log/journal/\n1.7G\t/var/log/journal/</code></pre>\n<p>Now that you know how much space the journal logs take, you can decide if you want to clear the logs or not. If you decide to clear the journal logs, let me show you a couple of ways of doing it.</p>\n<p>You can of course use the rm command to delete the files in the log folder but I won’t advise that. The journalctl command gives you the proper way of handling old logs.</p>\n<p>First thing you should do is to rotate journal files. This will mark the currently active journal logs as archive and create fresh new logs. It’s optional but a good practice to do so.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo journalctl --rotate</code></pre>\n<p>Now you have three ways to clear old journal logs. You delete logs older than a certain time or you delete older log files so that total log size is limited to the predefined disk space or you limit number of log files. Let’s see how to use all three methods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-clear-journal-log-older-than-x-days\">1. Clear journal log older than x days</h3>\n<p>Keep in mind that logs are important for auditing purpose so you should not delete all of them at the same time. Let’s say you want to keep the log history of just two days. To delete all entries older than two days, use this command:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2d</code></pre>\n<p>Here’s what the output may look like:</p>\n<pre><code>Vacuuming done, freed 1.6G of archived journals from /var/log/journal/1b9ab93094fa4978beba80fd3c48a18c</code></pre>\n<p>You can also change the provide time frame in hours like 2h, in minutes like 2m, in seconds like 2s. If you want bigger time units, you can 2weeks, 2months as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-restrict-logs-to-a-certain-size\">2. Restrict logs to a certain size</h3>\n<p>Another way is to restrict the log size. With this, it will delete the journal log files until the disk space taken by journal logs falls below the size you specified.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M</code></pre>\n<p>This will reduce the log size to around 100 MB.</p>\n<pre><code>Vacuuming done, freed 40.0M of archived journals from /var/log/journal/1b9ab93094fa4978beba80fd3c48a18c.</code></pre>\n<p>You can specify the size in GB with G, MB with M, KB with K etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-restrict-number-of-log-files\">3. Restrict number of log files</h3>\n<p>The third way is to limit the number of log files. The journalctl usually has log files for the system and for the users. As the logs get old they are archived in various files.</p>\n<p>You can limit the number of archive log files. Let’s say you want to have only five log files.</p>\n<pre><code>journalctl --vacuum-files=5</code></pre>\n<p>It will remove the older archive log files leaving only the specified number of log files.</p>\n<pre><code>Deleted archived journal /var/log/journal/1b9ab93094fa4978beba80fd3c48a18c/system@d9fbc18533be4cb69483adf2a61505ac-00000000001e0bba-00059745988c0982.journal (8.0M).\nDeleted archived journal /var/log/journal/1b9ab93094fa4978beba80fd3c48a18c/user-1000@f571e91e5c6748a8a74666a448df78dd-00000000001e21d4-00059747a2ebd5a3.journal (48.0M).\nDeleted archived journal /var/log/journal/1b9ab93094fa4978beba80fd3c48a18c/system@d9fbc18533be4cb69483adf2a61505ac-00000000001e2414-00059747a32024d0.journal (48.0M).\nVacuuming done, freed 104.0M of archived journals from /var/log/journal/1b9ab93</code></pre>",

            "content_html": "<p>Have you ever run <em>sudo apt-get upgrade</em>, only to be told there are packages that will be kept back? What this warning means is that the dependencies have changed on one of the software packages you have installed, and if upgrading that dependency would cause problems with the standard upgrade, the dependency in question is kept back. </p>\n<p>In other words, it's a precaution to prevent upgrades from breaking. Of course, you can always get around that by issuing the following command: </p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</pre>\n<p>However, that can be dangerous, as it may remove packages to resolve rather complex dependency problems. It's an issue that can be tricky to resolve, but not really. There are a couple of ways to resolve this issue. </p>\n<p>The first method would be to manually install the packages listed as kept back. Say you have packages base-files, sosreport, and ubuntu-server being kept back. You could install those packages manually with the command: </p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install base-files sosreport ubuntu-server</pre>\n<p>That command will install those packages and any dependencies they require. </p>\n<p>A second option is to install aptitude with: </p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install aptitude -y</pre>\n<p>Also use the safe-upgrade command, as in: </p>\n<pre>sudo aptitude safe-upgrade</pre>\n<p>This command will not remove any packages unless they are unused and will install the kept-back software. </p>\n<p>Either route you take, you'll get those kept-back packages installed. Which route you take will depend on if you want to add more software into the mix or do things manually. Since this is Linux, you always have choices. In this case, make the one that makes the most sense to you.</p>",
